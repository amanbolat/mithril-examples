# Mithril.js Examples

**https://mithril-examples.firebaseapp.com/**

Mithril.js is a modern client-side javascript framework for building Single Page Applications. The [official documentation](https://mithril.js.org/) provides a great introduction and a complete API reference. But sometimes it helps to just look at several examples of a framework in use. This website aims to provide those examples.

Feel free to submit ideas or contribute your own examples by opening up an issue or pull request. View CONTRIBUTING.md before you decide to open a PR. If you believe any of the examples are written in an outdated or non-idiomatic way, please create an issue with your proposed improvements.
